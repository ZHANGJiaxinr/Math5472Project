# Math5472Project
This is the code for course Math5472 final project. 

This R project aims to study and understand and estimate [Empirical Bayes Matrix Factorization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.06931). 

## Quick start
1. This code is applying the library  `flashr`. So you need to install [flashr](https://github.com/stephenslab/flashr#quick-start) according to its instruction first.

2. To see all of my work
```{r}
rmarkdown::render('simulate_missing.Rmd',params=list(args = myarg))
```
